          <b>Beat the eggs:</b>
          In a bowl, beat the eggs with a pinch of salt and pepper until they
          are well mixed. You can add a tablespoon of water or milk for a
          fluffier texture.
        </li>

        <li>
          <b> Heat the pan: </b>
          Place a non-stick frying pan over medium heat and add butter or oil.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b> Cook the omelette: </b>
          Once the butter is melted and bubbling, pour in the eggs. Tilt the pan
          to ensure the eggs evenly coat the surface.
        </li>

        <li>
          <b> Add the fillings:</b> When the eggs begin to set at the edges but
          are still slightly runny in the middle, sprinkle your chosen fillings
          over one half of the omelette.
        </li>

        <li>
          <b> Fold and serve:</b>
          As the omelette continues to cook, carefully lift one edge and fold it
          over the fillings. Let it cook for another minute, then slide it onto
          a plate.
        </li>

        <li>
          <b> Enjoy: </b>Serve hot, with additional salt and pepper if needed.
        </li>
      </ol>
